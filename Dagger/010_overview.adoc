== Dependency injection with Dagger 2

=== What is Dagger 2?

(((Dependency injection, Dagger 2)))
(((Dagger)))
Dagger 2 is dependency injection framework.
It is based on the Java Specification Request (JSR) 330.
It uses code generation and is based on annotations.
The generated code is very relatively easy to read and debug.
		

Dagger 2 uses the following annotations:

* `@Module` and `@Provides`: define classes and methods which provide dependencies
* `@Inject`: request dependencies. Can be used on a constructor, a field, or a method
* `@Component`: enable selected modules and used for performing dependency injection  

Dagger 2 uses generated code to access the fields and not reflection.
Therefore it is not allowed to use private fields for  field injection.
		
=== Defining dependency providers (object providers)
		
The term _dependency injection context_ is typically used to describe the set of objects which can be injected.

In Dagger 2, classes annotated with `@Module` are responsible for providing objects which can be injected.		
Such classes can define methods annotated with `@Provides`. 
The returned objects from these methods are available for dependency injection.
		
Methods annotated with `@Provides` can also express dependencies via method parameters. 
These dependencies are fulfilled by Dagger 2, if possible.

=== Defining dependencies (object consumers)

You use the `@Inject` annotation to define a dependency. 
If you annotate a constructor with `@Inject`, Dagger 2 can also use an instance of this object to fulfill dependencies.
This was done to avoid the definition of lots of `@Provides` methods for these objects.

=== Connecting consumers and providers
		
The `@Component` is used on an interface.
Such an interface is used by Dagger 2 to generate code.
The base pattern for the generated class is that `Dagger` is used as prefix followed by the interface name. 
This generate class has a `create` method which allows configuring the objects based on the given configuration. 
The methods defined on the interface are available to access the generated objects.
	
A `@Component` interface defines the connection between provider of objects (modules) and the objects which expresses a dependency.
The following table gives an overview of the usage of the Dagger annotations.

.Annotation summary of Dagger 2
|===
|Annotation |Usage

|`@Module`
|Used on classes which contains methods annotated with `@Provides`.

|`@Provides`
|Can be used on methods in classes annotated with `@Module` and is used for methods which provides objects for dependencies injection.

|`@Singleton`
| Single instance of this provided object is created and shared.

| `@Component`
| Used on an interface. 
This interface is used by Dagger 2 to generate code which uses the modules to fulfill the requested dependencies.

=== Scope annotations
You can use the `@Singleton` annotation to indicate that there should be only one instance of the object.

=== Special treatment of fields in Dagger
        
Dagger 2 does not inject fields automatically. 
It can also not inject private fields. 
If you want to use field injection you have to define a method in your `@Component` interface which takes the instance into which you want to inject as parameter.


=== Using Dagger 2 with Eclipse and Maven

To use Eclipse and Maven together with Dagger 2 you can install the Maven tooling and the apt plug-in which allows Maven to configure the annotation processors.

For Eclipse Maven support use the update site of your release and afterwards install the m2e-apt tooling via the
http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/m2e-extensions/m2e-apt update site.
		
After the installation you must enable apt-processing on via the Eclipse preferences in menu:Window[Preferences>Maven>Annotation Processing]. 
Select _Automatically configure JDT APT_.
