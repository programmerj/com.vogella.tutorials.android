== Dagger 2 and Android

[[android_dagger_problem]]
=== Using dependency injection with Android
		
Many Android components, e.g. activities, are instantiated by the Android framework and not in your code.
This makes it difficult to supply dependencies via constructors to Android components.

=== Using Dagger 2 in Android

To enable Dagger 2 add the following dependencies to your _build.gradle_ file.

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.10'
annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.10'
----

If you want to use classes from the _dagger.android_ package, like _DaggerActivity_, also add the following dependencies to your build.gradle file.
This is also needed, if you want to inject Activities components like activities or fragments.

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android:2.10'
annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-processor:2.10'
----

If you want to use the support libraries with Dagger 2, you also have to add the following to your build.gradle

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-support:2.10'
