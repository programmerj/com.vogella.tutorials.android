== Exercise: Dependency injection in Android Activities with Dagger 2

[[exercise_androiddagger_target]]
=== Target of this exercise

In this exercise Dagger 2 is demonstrated in an Android application.
In our simple app, there is an activity that allows a user to authenticate some credentials. 
The result value of the implementation is displayed in a text field.

[[exercise_androiddagger_project]]
=== Create project

Create a new project called _com.vogella.android.dagger2simple_ with the top level package _com.vogella.android.dagger2simple_.
	
[[exercise_androiddagger_gradle]]
=== Enter Gradle dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your _build.gradle_ file.

[source,java]
----
compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.10'
compile 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android:2.10'
annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-processor:2.10'
annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.10'
----

=== Define your dependency graph

As mentioned above, Android components (activities, fragments, etc.) are instantiated by the Android framework which makes it difficult to use dependency injection on them.
Fortunately, Dagger provides classes that simplifies the dependency injection into Android components.
This requires a little setup work to get your application running.

First, create an interface with the name _IMainActivitySubcomponent_.

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/IMainActivitySubcomponent.java[]
----

This interface represents a Dagger subcomponent which is able to inherit bindings from any parent (sub-)component. 
It extends the _AndroidInjector_ to perform member injection on a concrete Android component type (in our case _MainActivity_) and also specifies the corresponding builder.

To add you subcomponent to a parent component create a module named _ActivityModule_ like the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/ActivityModule.java[]
----

With the help of the _subcomponents_ parameter in the `@Module` annotation, the subcomponent is made available to every component that uses the ActivityModule.
This class offers an abstract method that binds the builder of the subcomponent to the AndroidInjector.Factory.


Next, create an interface called _IApplicationComponent_.
This component is responsible for injecting the _Application_ class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/IApplicationComponent.java[]
----

In the `@Component` annotation the modules are specified which are used to create the implementation of the component.
Here, we now add our ActivityModule and therefore also make use of our subcomponent.
While we reference our ActivityModule to inject activities, we also reference the _AndroidInjectionModule_ which is needed to ensure the binding of the Android base types (Activities, Fragments, etc.).


Now, create a class named _NetworkApi_ like the following.
This class is used to inject it into an activity.

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/NetworkApi.java[]
----

With the `@Inject` annotation for the constructor, we tell Dagger that an object of this class is injectable into other objects.
Dagger automatically calls this constructor, if an instance of this class is requested. 

Alternatively, for example when you are not allowed to change the injectable class (to annotate the constructor), you have the possibility to provide a new static method to the ActivityModule that returns an instance of the NetworkApi class.
If you prefer this way, remove the `@Inject` annotation from the NetworkApi constructor, and add the following lines to your ActivityModule class.

[source, java]
----
	@Provides
    static NetworkApi provideNetworkApi(){
        return new NetworkApi();
    }
----

[[exercise_androiddagger_using]]
=== Wiring up the application

Next, create a class named _MyApplication_ that extends _Application_ and implements _HasDispatchingActivityInjector_ like the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/MyApplication.java[]
----

Here, we use our IApplicationComponent (not prefixed with _Dagger_) to inject our Application class.
This way a _DispatchingAndroidInjector_ is injected which is then returned when an injector for an activity is requested (through _activityInjector()_).
This injector uses the _AndroidInjector.Factory_ which comes from the ActivityModule to find the corresponding builder of the activity (IActivitySubcomponent.Builder).
It then creates the concrete _AndroidInjector_ (in our case IActivitySubcomponent) which can then be used to inject an activity.


Of course the Application class needs to registered via the manifest like the following. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----

Create an class called _MainActivity_ and also create a xml layout file called _activity_main.xml_ like the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/android/activity_main.xml[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/android/MainActivity.java[]
----

When now calling _AndroidInjection.inject(this)_ the DispatchingAndroidInjector from the Application class is used to inject the activity with an instance of the NetworkApi class. 

[[exercise_androiddagger_validate]]
=== Validate

Run your application, the user interface should report that dependency injection worked. 
If not, have a look at the generated classes in the _app/build/generated/apt_ folder. 
The generated classes by Dagger are well structured and should give a hint what went wrong.
