== Exercise: Define and consume local service
	
This exercise demonstrates how to bind to a local service from an activity.
	
The service is started after the Android device boots and simulates that it periodically fetches data.
The activity binds itself to the service to access its data.
	
Create a new project called _com.vogella.android.localservice_ with the activity called _MainActivity_ using the _Empty Activity_ template.
	
Create the following `LocalWordService` class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/LocalWordService.java[]
----	
	
Create the following two classes, which will be registered as `BroadcastReceivers`.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/MyScheduleReceiver.java[]
----	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/MyStartServiceReceiver.java[]
----	
	
Register all components in your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ownservice/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----	
	
Change the
layout file of the
activity
similar to the following example.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ownservice/main.xml[]
----	
	
Change your
activity
class
to the following code.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/MainActivity.java[]
----	
	
Run your application. If you press the button, the data is fetched
again from the service and the
`ListView`
is updated.
