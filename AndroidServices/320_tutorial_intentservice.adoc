== Exercise: Using services and service communication
	
The following example demonstrates how to use a service to download a file from the Internet based on a button click from an activity. Once done, the service notifies the activity via a broadcast receiver that the download is complete.
	
In this exercise you use the `IntentService` class, as this class provides automatic background processing.
	
Create a new project called _com.vogella.android.service.receiver_ with the activity called _MainActivity_.
	
Create the following class for the service.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/intentservice/DownloadService.java[]
----	
	
Add this class to the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.
Also add the permission to write to external storage and to access the Internet.
The resulting _AndroidManifest.xml_ file should look similar to the following listing.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/intentservice/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----	
	
Change the layout file of your activity to the following.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/intentservice/activity_main.xml[]
----
	
Change `MainActivity` to the following.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/intentservice/MainActivity.java[]
----
	
If you run your example and press the button, the download should be performed by the service. 
Once done, the user interface is updated and a `Toast` with the file name is shown.
	
Change the setting so that the service runs in its own process.
Ensure that the application still works, as broadcast receivers are received across process boundaries.
