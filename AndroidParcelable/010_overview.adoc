[[Parceable]]
== Parceable

A _Parceable_ is the Android implementation of the Java Serializable. 
It assumes a certain structure and way of processing it.
This fast it relatively fast  compared 	to the standard Java serialization.
	
	
To allow your custom object to be parsed to another component they need to implement the `android.os.Parcelable` interface.
It must also provide a static final method called `CREATOR`	which must implement the `Parcelable.Creator` interface.
