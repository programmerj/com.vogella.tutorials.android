== AIDL for services in a different process
	
		To bind to a
		service
		which runs in a different process, you need to use
		Inter Process
		Communication (IPC) as the data needs to be sent between
		different
		processes. To do so, you need to create a AIDL file which
		looks
		similar to a Java interface, but ends with the
		_.aidl_
		file extension
		and is only allowed to extend other AIDL files.
	
	
		This approach is required if you need to bind to a service
		running in
		another process, i.e., if your service is consumed by other
		Android applications.
	
	
		You can find more information about this approach in the
		http://developer.android.com/guide/components/aidl.html[
			Android developer documentation about AIDL
		]
		.
