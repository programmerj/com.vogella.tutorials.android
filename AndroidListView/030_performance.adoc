== ListViews and performance
[[adapterperformance_motivation]]
=== Motivation
		
Performance is especially important on Android as users expect fast reaction times. 
Compared to desktop computers an Android device is relatively slow from the hardware perspective.
		
This part describes how to reduce these operations to implement your custom list adapter efficiently. 
The default Android adapters like `ArrayAdapter` are already performance optimized.
	
[[adapterperformance_problems]]
=== Time consuming operations
		
Every view which gets inflated from an XML layout file will result in a Java object. 
Inflating layouts and creating Java objects are expensive with regards to time and memory consumption.
		
In addition using the `findViewById()` method is relatively time consuming, even though it is not as bad as XML inflating.
	
[[adapterperformance_convertview]]
=== Avoiding layout inflation and object creation
		
A `ListView` typically contains more data than the number of displayed rows.
If the user scrolls the list, then the rows and their associated views will be scrolled out of the visible area. 
The Java objects which represent the rows can be reused for newly visible rows.
		
If Android determines that a row is not visible anymore, it allows the `getView()` of the adapter method to reuse the associated view via the `convertView` parameter.
		
The adapter can assign new  data to the views contained in the view hierarchy of the `convertView`. 
This avoids inflating an XML file and creating new Java objects.
		
In case Android cannot reuse a row, the Android system passes `null` to the `convertView` parameter. 
Therefore the adapter implementation needs to check for this.
	
[[adapterperformance_holder]]
=== View holder pattern
		
A _ViewHolder_ implementation allows to avoid the `findViewById()` method in an adapter.
		
A `ViewHolder` class is typically a static inner class in your adapter which holds references to the relevant views in your layout. 
This reference is assigned to the row view as a tag via the `setTag()` method.
		
If we receive a `convertView` object, we can get the instance of the `ViewHolder` via the `getTag()` method and assign the new attributes to the views via the `ViewHolder` reference.
		
While this sounds complex this is approximately 15 % faster than using the `findViewById()` method.

[[adapterperformance_example]]
=== Example
		
The following code shows a performance optimized adapter implementation which reuses existing views and implements the holder pattern.
