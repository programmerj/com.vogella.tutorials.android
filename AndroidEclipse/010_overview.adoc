== Using the Eclipse IDE for Android development

=== Introduction

Google promotes Android Studio as primary IDE for Android development.
As Android uses Gradle it is relatively simple to use the Eclipse IDE for developing Android.

See https://github.com/greensopinion/gradle-android-eclipse.

[NOTE]

Of course, Eclipse does have any Android specific wizards with this approach.
