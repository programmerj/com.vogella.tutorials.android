== Exercise: Preference setting for the RSSfeed

In this exercise you allow the user to enter his preferred URL for an RSS feed via another activity. 
This activity uses a preference xml file to define the user interface. 
	
=== Create preference file

Create an Android XML resource called _mypreferences.xml_ in the xml folder.
Add entries to this file similar to the following listing. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/preferences/mypreferences.xml[]
----
	
=== Create settings activity

Create the class `SettingsActivity`.
It should extends `PreferenceActivity`. 
This activity loads the preference file and allows the user to change the values.

[source,java]
----
include::res/preferences/SettingsActivity.java[]
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember that you need to register the activity in the Android manifest.

=== Connect your settings activity

Ensure that you open the preference activity via the `onOptionsItemSelected()` method.
The relevant code is demonstrated in the following listing.

[source,java]

=== Use the preference value to load the RSS feed

The following code snippet demonstrates how you can access the preference value in a method.

[source,java]
----
// if you use this in a service or activity you can use this
// if you use this in a fragment use getActivity() or getContent() as parameter
SharedPreferences settings = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this);
String url = settings.getString("url", "http://www.vogella.com/article.rss");
----

=== Validating

Run your application. 
Select from your action bar the `Settings` action.
You should be able to enter a URL. 
If you press the back button and press the refresh button, ensure that the value of the url preference is used in your activity.

=== Optional: Show the current value in the settings

value in the preference screen.
