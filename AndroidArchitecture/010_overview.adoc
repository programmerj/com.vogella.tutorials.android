== Architectures for Android

The Android programming model encourages the creation of large activities or fragments.
These components typically contain both business and UI logic. 
This makes testing and maintenance of Android applications more difficult.

Several patterns are popular within the Android community to improve testability.
The most popular architecture choices are:
* Model View Presenter (MVP) 
* Model View View Model (MVVM) together with Android Data Binding
