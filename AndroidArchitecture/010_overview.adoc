== Architectures for Android

The Android default templates encourages the creation of large activities or fragments.
These components typically contain both business and UI logic. 
This makes testing and therefore the maintenance of Android applications harder.

Several patterns are popular within the Android community to improve testability.

The most popular architecture choices are:

* Model View Presenter (MVP) 
* Model View View Model (MVVM) together with Android Data Binding

[NOTE]
====
The view in MVP or MVVM is not the same as the `View` class in Android.
A view in MVP it usually implemented via a fragment, activity or a dialog.
