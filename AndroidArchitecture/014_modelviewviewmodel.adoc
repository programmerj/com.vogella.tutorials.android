== The Model View View Model architecture for Android

The Model View View Model design pattern is typical used together with Android data binding.

=== The view

A view component in MVP contains a visual part of the application.

The view binds to observable variables and actions exposed by the view model typically using the data binding framework.

=== The view model

The view model contains the data required for the view.
In a data binding scenario is uses observable data needed by the view.
It also allows to pass events to the model.

=== The model

Contains the data and the code to fetch and update the data. 

Basically the same as the model in the MVP.
