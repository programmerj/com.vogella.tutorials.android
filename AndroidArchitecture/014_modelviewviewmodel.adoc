== The Model View View Model architecture for Android

The Model View View Model design pattern is also known as Model View Binder.

=== The view

A view component in MVP contains a visual part of the application.

The view binds to observable variables and actions exposed by the view model typically using the data binding framework.

=== The view model

The view model contains the data required for the view.
It is an abstraction of the view and exposes public properties and commands.
It uses observable data to notify the view about changes.
It also allows to pass events to the model.
It is also a value converter from the raw model data to presentation-friendly properties)

=== The model

Contains a data provider and the code to fetch and update the data.
The data can be retrieved from different sources, e.g., a REST API or a database.

Basically the same as the model in the MVP.

=== Differences to MVP

MVVM uses data binding and is therefore a more event driven architecture.
MVP typically has a one to one mapping between the presenter and the view, while MVVM can map many views to one view model
In MVVM the view model has no reference to the view, while in MVP the view knows the presenter.
