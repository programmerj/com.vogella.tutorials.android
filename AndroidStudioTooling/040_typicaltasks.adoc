== Using Android Studio

[WARNING]
====
Android Studio menus entries are dynamic calculated based on your current selection.
Unfortunately this feature seems currently a bit buggy. 
If you do not see a certain menu entry, try selecting the _app_ entry again.

=== Creating a new layout file

To create a new layout file, select your app folder, right click on it and select menu:File[New>Android resource file]. 
Choose the the _Layout_ option to create a layout file.

[WARNING]
====
The availability of the menu entries and the resulting dialog depends on the selected folder.
If the entry is not available or the resulting dialog is wrong, ensure you select the 'app' folder.
====
		
The easiest way to create a new resource file, e.g., a layout file, is the context menu on the corresponding folder.
To create a new folder, see <<androidstudio_creatingresourcefolder>>.
This is demonstrates for the creation of a new layout file in the following screenshot.

NOTE: If you want to create a new layout file for a certain qualifier, you can select it in the creation dialog.

[[androidstudio_creatingresourcefile]]
=== Creating a new resource file

Similar to the above described creation of layout file, you can create other resources, by changing the selection in the displayed dialog.

[[androidstudio_creatingresourcefolder]]
=== Creating a new resource folder
		
If a resource folder is missing, you have to create it. 
This is demonstrated by the following screenshots for the creation of the _layout-port_folder.

[[androidstudio_workingonlayoutfiles]]
=== Working on layout files
		
Android Studio offers a visual and a text editor for editing your layout files. The
easiest way to add new widgets to
an existing layout file is to find
these
elements in the
_Palette_
and drag and
drop
them into your layout.
In the visual design
mode
you can remove a
view by
right-clicking it and by
selecting the
_Delete_
entry for the context menu.
		
Android Studio replaces placeholder values with the
real values. This makes it sometimes harder to compare
files.
Double-click on the value in this case to see the placeholder value.

[[androidstudio_createimage]]
=== Add images to your project

		
From the menu of Android Studio, select menu:File[New>Vector Assert] to create a new vector drawable.
The creation process is demonstrated for the _ic_tethering_ icon.

[[androidstudio_createmenu]]
=== Add a new menu resource
		
If not yet present, create a new directory called _menu_.

image::menu_resources10.png[Create menu directory]
		
Create a new XML resource called _mainmenu.xml_ for your menu.

image::menu_resources20.png[Create new menu resources]
		
Afterwards you can manually edit the generated file via the _Text_ tab or use the _Design_ tab to edit it via drag and drag.

=== Create preference file

If you project does not have an _/app/res/xml_ folder create one.

You can now create an Android XML resource in the xml folder.

[[androidstudio_viewinglogentries]]
=== See the log statements of your Android application
		
Use the _Android_ view (Shortcut: kbd:[Alt+6]) to see the log statements in Android Studio.



		
== Java programming tasks

=== Generating Getter/setting, toString, etc.
		
Select the menu:Code[Generate...] menu entry to generate getter, setter, constructors, etc.
		
=== Rename a resource
		
To rename a resource, e.g., a Java file, select menu:Refactor[Rename...] from the context menu of the corresponding resource or use the kbd:[Shift+F6] shortcut.


=== Structure overview of a class / interface (similar to Outline view in Eclipse)

To see the structure of a class or an interface you can use the _Structure_ view (kbd:Alt+7[]).
This gives you an overview of the selected element, similar to the _Outline_ view in Eclipse.

[[androidstudio_sourceupdate]]
=== Using Java 8 in Android applications
        
As of Android Studio 2.4 you can use Java 8 features, with some restrictions. 
As of Android Gingebread (API 9) and above you can use:

* Lambda expressions
* java.util.function
        
        
As of Android 24 you can use:

* Default and static interface methods
* Repeatable annotations
* Streams
* Reflection APIs

To enable Java 8 in your project use the following settings. 

[source,java]
----
android {
 ...
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}
----

=== Using live template in your Java code
	
Android studio provides templates for typical task in Java and Android. 
The following list contains a few of the most useful:

* Toast - Creates a Toast
* fbc - findViewById with cast
* const - Defines a constant
*	
	
Use menu:File[Settings>Editor>Live Templates] to see the full list.
