== Exercise: Use JobScheduler from a receiver

=== Target of this exercise

We demonstrate how to trigger a job which triggers a service from a broadcast receiver.
You registers a receiver for the boot completely event.
It will trigger the receiver, which registers the job which starts your custom service.

=== Create the receiver

Create the following utility class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/receiver/Util.java[]
----

Create the following receiver

[source,java]
----
include::res/receiver/MyStartServiceReceiver.java[]
----

Register the receiver in the Android manifest for the BOOT_COMPLETED event.
[source,xml]
----
<receiver android:name="MyStartServiceReceiver" >
	<intent-filter>
		<action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />
	</intent-filter>
</receiver>
----

=== Create your job 

[source,java]
----
include::res/receiver/ScheduleWordUpdateJobService.java[]
----
=== Trigger the boot completed event from the command line

[source,shell]
----
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools$ ./adb root
~/Android/Sdk/platform-tools$ ./adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED
----
=== Validate 

Trigger the boot completed event from the command line or reboot your device.
Start your application.
