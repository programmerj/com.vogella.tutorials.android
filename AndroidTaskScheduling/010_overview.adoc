== Scheduling tasks
=== How not to do it

If you have a repetitive task in your Android app, you need to consider that  activities and services can be terminated by the Android system to free up resources.
Therefore you can not rely on standard Java schedule like the `TimerTasks` class.


=== Options for scheduling

The Android system currently has two main means to schedule tasks:

* the (outdated) `AlarmManager` 
* the `JobScheduler` API.

Modern Android applications should use the `JobScheduler` API.  
Apps can schedule jobs while letting the system optimize based on memory, power, and connectivity conditions.
