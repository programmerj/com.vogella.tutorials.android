== Exercise: Custom view and touch events

=== Draw via touch
		
This exercise demonstrates the handling of (single) touch events within a custom view.
		
Create an Android project called _com.vogella.android.touch.single_ with the activity called _SingleTouchActivity_.
This activity uses a `DialogFragment` to set the color which is used for drawing.

Create the following layout called `fragment_colorpicker.xml`.

[source, xml]
----
include::res/single/fragment_colorpicker.xml[]
----


Create the following `TouchEventView` class which implements a View which supports single touch.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/single/SingleTouchEventView.java[]
----

Adjust the `activity_main.xml` layout file to the following.

[source, xml]
----
include::res/single/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Add this view to your _activity_.

[source,java]
----
include::res/single/SingleTouchActivity.java[]
----
		
If you run your application you will be able to draw on the screen with your finger (or with the mouse in the emulator).
		
Change your coding so that you use a layout definition based on XML. 

[NOTE]
====
To use your own view in an XML layout definition you have to use the full-qualified class name (class including package information).
====

=== Allow to pick the line width

Add a menu to your application

[source, xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">

    <item android:title="Pick pen" android:id="@+id/action_pickpen"/>
</menu>
----


		
=== Tracking
		
Add code to your drawing example so that the current position of a finger is marked via a circle.
To draw a circle you can use the `addCircle(x, y, 50, Path.Direction.CW)` method call on a `Path` or use the canvas element directly.
		
Make sure that only the current position is highlighted with a circle.
The circle should appears as soon as the finger goes down and vanish once the finger goes up.
		
The result should look like the following.
