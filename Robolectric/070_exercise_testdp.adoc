== Exercise: Using Robolectric and Android Studio to test your activity

This exercise describes how to write a unit test for an Activity using Robolectric and Android Studio.

=== Project setup

Create an application called _com.vogella.android.robolectric_ with an activity call `RobolectricActivity`.
Use the _com.vogella.android.robolectric_ top level package name.

To use Robolectric in your application, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/build.gradle[]
----

=== Activity to test 

Adjust your activity to the following:

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/RobolectricActivity.java[]
----

Adjust the layout file of your activity to the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/activity_main.xml[]
----

=== Create a unit test for the ativity

Create the following test class and place it in your _src/test_ directory.
This class tests, that the TextView has a top and bottom margin of 5dp and a left and right margin of 10dp.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/RobolectricActivityTest.java[]
----

A method with a `@Before` annotation creates the RobolectricActivity.
A method which is annotated with `@Test` is an actual test method and represents a single JUnit test case.

=== Create the run configuration

Now create a run configuration to run your unit test.
To do so, select _Run_ and then _Edit Configurations..._.
Use the green _+_ sign at the top left corner to add a new run configuration and select _Android JUnit_.
Make your JUnit run configuration look like the following:

At _Use classpath of module_ select the app module of your Android application.
As _Working directory_ use the directory of your app module.
_Class_ is the file which contains your unit tests (in this case your ctivityTest class).

Now you can simply select and run this run configuration to run your unit tests.

=== Extend the tests

Extend your activity and your test so that the following tests are successful.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/RobolectricActivityTestExtended.java[]
