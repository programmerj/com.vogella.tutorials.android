== Exercise: Using Robolectric and Android Studio to test your Activity

This section describes how to write a simple unit test for an Activity using Robolectric and Android Studio.
A _TextView_ with a margin is created which is then tested.

=== Project setup

To test Robolectric create an application called _com.vogella.android.robolectricfiles_.
Use the _com.vogella.android.robolectric_ top level package name.

To use Robolectric in your application, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/build.gradle[]
----

=== Create a Activity to test 

Create the following Activity class called _MainActivity_ and place it in your default package.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/MainActivity.java[]
----


Create the following xml layout file called _activity_main.xml_ and place it in your _res/layout_ folder.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/activity_main.xml[]
----

=== Create a unit test for an Activity

Create the following test class called _MainActivityTest_ and place it in your _src/test_ directory.
This class simply tests, that the TextView has a top and bottom margin of 5dp and a left and right margin of 10dp.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_testdp/MainActivityTest.java[]
----

A method with a `@Before` annotation runs before every test method and is usually used to do some setup work for the test. 
In our exercise, the method just creates the MainActivity.
A method which is annotated with `@Test` is an actual test method and represents a single JUnit test case.

=== Create the run configuration

Now create a run configuration to run your unit test.
To do so, select _Run_ and then _Edit Configurations..._.
Use the green _+_ sign at the top left corner to add a new run configuration and select _Android JUnit_.
Make your JUnit run configuration look like the following:

At _Use classpath of module_ select the app module of your Android application.
As _Working directory_ use the directory of your app module.
_Class_ is the file which contains your unit tests (in this case your MainActivityTest class).

Now you can simply select and run this run configuration to run your unit tests.
