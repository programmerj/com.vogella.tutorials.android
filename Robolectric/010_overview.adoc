== Robolectric

=== What is Robolectric

http://robolectric.org[Robolectric] is a framework that allows you to write unit tests and run them on a desktop JVM while still using Android API.

Robolectric provides a JVM compliant version of the _android.jar_ file. 
Robolectric handles inflation of views, resource loading, and lots of other stuff thatâ€™s implemented in native C code on Android devices. 

This enables you to run your Android tests in your continuous integration environment without any additional setup.
_Robolectric_ supports resource handling, e.g., inflation of `views`.
You can also use the `findViewById()` to search in a `view`.

Robolectric is not an integration test framework, i.e., you cannot not test the interaction of Android components with it.

Robolectric does not require additional mocking frameworks, of course it is still possible to use frameworks like Mockito if desired.


=== Shadow objects

Robolectric replaced all Android classes by so-called _shadow objects_.
If a method is implemented by Robolectric, it forwards these method calls to the shadow object.
Shadow objects behave similar to the Android implementation.
If a method is not implemented by the shadow object, it simply returns a default value, e.g., null or 0.

To access a shadow object use `Shadows.shadowOf`.
