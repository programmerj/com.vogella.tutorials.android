== Exercise: Using Butterknife in your Android project

=== Create project

Create a new Android project with the package `com.vogella.android.usinglibs`. 
Add a text view with the `@+id/textView` to it and a button to the existing layout with the `@+id/button` ID.

=== Add Butterknife to your Gradle build configuration

Add the `com.jakewharton:butterknife` in its latest version as compile dependency `build.gradle` file.

[source,groovy]
----
include::res/build.gradle[]
----

=== Use view injection in your Android activity


Use `@BindView`, `@OnClick` and `ButterKnife.bind` to get the views injected.

ifdef::show_exercise_solution[]

The following shows a possible solution.

[source,java]
----
include::res/MainActivity.java[]
----
endif::show_exercise_solution[]
	
=== Validate setup

Run your application and ensure that the `TextView` gets injected and the button event is fired, if you click the button.
