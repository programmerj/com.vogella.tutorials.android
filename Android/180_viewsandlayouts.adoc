== Using views and view groups to design the user interface

=== View - The widgets in Android
	
A _view_ in Android represents a widget, e.g., a button, or a layout manager.
The Android SDK provides standard views (widgets), e.g., via the `Button`, `TextView`, `EditText` classes.
Additional libraries provide more complex widgets, for example, `RecyclerView`.
	
All views in Android extend the `android.view.View` class, this class provides a lot of base functionality for subclasses.
For example, it provides the base support for touch.

The main packages for views are part of the `android.view` namespace for all the base classes and `android.widget` for the default widgets of the Android platform.

=== Using a layout manager
		
A layout manager is responsible for the layout of itself and its child views.
The base class for these layout managers is the `android.view.ViewGroup` class which extends the `android.view.View` class.

Android supports different default layout managers.
Layout managers can be nested to create complex layouts.
		
The most relevant layout managers in Android are:

* `ConstraintLayout - provided by an extra library`
* `LinearLayout`
* `FrameLayout`
* `RelativeLayout`
* `GridLayout`


[[layoutmanager_attributes]]
=== Layout attributes
		
All layout manager can be configured via attributes. 
Children can also define attributes which may be evaluated by their parent layout.
		
Children can specify their desired width and height via the following attributes.

* `android:layout_width` - Defines the width of the widget.
* `android:layout_height` - Defines the height of the widget.
		
		
Views can define their size. 
This can be done in units of measurement or via pre-defined layout values.
For example, as `100dp`. 
		
The `match_parent` value tells the application to maximize the widget in its parent. 
The `wrap_content` value tells the layout to allocate the minimum amount so that the widget is rendered correctly. 
The effect of these elements is demonstrated in the following graphics.

=== Overview of Android layout managers

[[layoutmanager_constraintlayout]]
==== Constraint layout

Constraint layout is provided by an external library.
It allows you to use a flat view hierarchy and has great performance.
Also the design tools support constraint layout very well.
New projects should prefer the usage of constraint layout.


[[layoutmanager_framelayout]]
==== FrameLayout
		
`FrameLayout` is a layout manager which draws all child elements on top of each other. 
This allows to create nice visual effects.
		
The following screenshot shows the Gmail application which uses `FrameLayout` to display several button on top of another layout.

[[layoutmanager_linearlayout]]
==== LinearLayout
		
`LinearLayout` puts all its child elements into a single column or row depending on the `android:orientation` attribute. 
Possible values for this attribute are `horizontal` and `vertical`.
`horizontal` is the default value.
		

If horizontal is used, the child elements are layouted as indicated by the following picture.
		
image::linearlayout20.png[]
		
Vertical would result in a layout as depicted in the following picture.

`LinearLayout` can be nested to achieve more complex layouts.
		
		
`LinearLayout` supports assigning a weight to individual children via the `android:layout_weight` layout parameter. 
This value specifies how much of the extra space in the layout is allocated to the corresponding view. 
If, for example, you have two widgets and the first one defines a
`layout_weight`
of 1 and the second of 2, the first will get 1/3 of the available
space and the other one 2/3. You can also set the
`layout_width`
to
zero to always have a certain ratio.
		
[[layoutmanager_relativelayout]]
==== RelativeLayout
		
`RelativeLayout`
allows positioning the widget relative to each other. This can be
used for
complex layouts. RelativeLayout is a complex
layout manager and should only be
used if such a complex layout is required, as it performs a resource
intensive
calculation
to layout its children.
		
		
A simple usage for `RelativeLayout` is if you want to center a single component. 
Just add one component to the `RelativeLayout` and set the `android:layout_centerInParent` attribute to true.

[[gridlayout_overview]]
==== GridLayout
		
`GridLayout` allows you to organize views into a grid / table. 
GridLayout separates its drawing area into: rows, columns, and cells.
		
You can specify how many columns the grid should have.
For each view you can specify  in which row and column it should be placed and how many columns and rows it should use. 
If not specified, `GridLayout` uses defaults, e.g., one column, one row and the view position  depends on the order of the declaration.

		
The following layout file defines a layout using `GridLayout`.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/gridlayout/main.xml[]

This creates a user interface similar to the following screenshot.

[[gridlayout_scrollview]]
=== ScrollView
		
The `ScrollView` or the `HorizontalScrollView` class is useful to make views available, even if they do not fit onto the screen.
A scroll view can contain one view, e.g., a layout manager containing more views.
If the child view is too large, scroll view allows scrolling the content.
		
image::layout_scrollview10.png[Scroll view]
		

The following code shows an example layout file which uses a `ScrollView`.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/scrollview/simple.xml[]
----
		
The `android:fillViewport="true"` attribute ensures that the scrollview is set to the full screen even if the elements are smaller than one screen.
