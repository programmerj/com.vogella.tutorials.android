== Exercise: Your first view interaction

=== Review generated layout

In your project which you created in the <<androidstudio_starter>> exercise, open the
`activity_main.xml` layout file located in the `res/layout` folder.

Investigate the XML layout in the visual editor as well in as the XML structure.

=== Adjust views

Remove all views, except the top level entry which is the layout manager. 
In the visual design mode you can remove a view by right-clicking it and by selecting the _Delete_ entry for the context menu.

If necessary, change the layout manager to `RelativeLayout`.	
The result layout file should look similar to the following file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutsimple/activity_main.xml[]
----		

[NOTE]
====		
Android Studio replaces placeholder values with the real values. 
This makes it sometimes harder to compare files.
Double-click on the value in this case to see the placeholder value.
====
		
Add an _Plain Text_ widget (EditText) and a _Button_ to your layout.
The easiest way is to find these elements in the _Palette_ and drag and drop them into your layout.
		
		
Use the text (XML) editor to change the ID of the new _EditText_ field to `main_input`.
In the XML file this looks like `@+id/main_input`.
		
Change the button text to _Start_ via the `android:text` property in your layout file.
Assign the name `onClick` to the `android:onClick` property of your `Button`.

[NOTE]
====
This defines that a `public void onClick (View view)` method is be called in the activity once the button is pressed.
This method is implemented in the next step.
====		

After these changes your layout file should be similar to the following code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutsimple/solution_activity_main.xml[]
----
		
[NOTE]
====
You see some warning messages in the editor, e.g., because you used hard-codes strings. 
These can be ignored for small demo applications.
====

=== Validate layout

You can start your application in the emulator or use the layout review in your IDE.
The resulting layout should look like the following screenshot.
		
image::exercise_firstlayout10.png[Final layout, pdfwidth=30%]
		
If you run your application and press the button your application crashes because you still need to adjust your activity.
		
	
=== Implement button behavior in your activity

Implement the following method in your `MainActivity` class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutsimple/onClick.java[]
----		

=== Validate button interaction
		
Start your application. Press your button and validate that a popup message (Toast) is shown.
		

	
=== Display text from your EditText field
		
Go back to the source code and use the `findViewById(id)` method with the correct `id` and cast the returned object into `EditText`.

[source,java]
----
EditText text = (EditText) findViewById(id)
----

You can get the right id via the R` class. 
It should be stored under ID and called _main_input_.
		
		
Use the `text.getText().toString()` method to read the string in the editor field and add the text to your Toast message.
		
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_layoutsimple/solution_MainActivity.java[]
----
	
=== Validate popup message
		
Restart your application and ensure that the message displays the text which the text field contains.
