== Exercise: Getting started with Android Studio and Kotlin

At the Google I/O 2017 Google announced that the programming language Kotlin is now officially supported for Android app development using Android Studio.
After configuration, you can start using Kotlin right away in your existing Android project (no conversion is needed) as Kotlin can call Java code and vice versa.
This exercise shows how to configure Android Studio for Android app development with Kotlin.

=== Using Kotlin with Android Studio < 3.0

To use Kotlin in Android Studio prior to version 3.0 you have to manually install the Kotlin plugin.
To do so, start Android Studio and open _Plugins_ from the _Configure_ menu.

After the installation is finished, restart Android Studio and you are ready to use Kotlin.

==== Create new project

It is not possible to create a new Android project using Kotlin from the start in Android Studio < 3.0.
If you want to create a new project with Kotlin, first follow http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html#androidstudio_starter[this tutorial] to create a new Android Java project.
Then, follow http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Android/article.html#add-kotlin-support-to-existing-android-java-project[this part] of the tutorial to add support for Kotlin and convert existing files.

=== Using Kotlin with Android Studio >= 3.0

Starting from Android Studio 3.0 the Kotlin plugin is already installed. 
No additional setup is required.

==== Create new project

To create a new Android project with Kotlin support enabled, simply check the _Include Kotlin support_ checkbox in the new project wizard.

=== Add Kotlin support to existing Android Java project

To configure Kotlin in your project choose menu:Tools[_Kotlin_ > _Configure Kotlin in Project_] from the menu.
This modifies the project and module build.gradle files.
The following shows a sample project build.gradle file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/kotlin/project_build.gradle[]
----	

With the help of the module build.gradle file the _kotlin-android_ plugin is applied and the corresponding dependency is imported.
The following shows an abridged module build.gradle file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/kotlin/module_build.gradle[]
----	

The Kotlin plugin also brings support for converting existing Java files to Kotlin files.
To do so, simply select the desired Java file and choose menu:Code[_Convert Java file to Kotlin file_] from the menu.

Remember that you do not have to convert all your existing Java files to Kotlin as Kotlin can call Java code and vice versa.  
If you have not already configured Kotlin for your project, Android Studio now prompts you to configure it.

=== Create a new Kotlin file

To create a new Kotlin file instead of a Java file, simply choose menu:File[_Kotlin File/Class_] from the menu.
