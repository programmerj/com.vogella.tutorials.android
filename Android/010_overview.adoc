== High-level overview of Android development

=== The Android operating system
		
_Android_ is an operating system based on the Linux kernel. 
Android is developed in the _Android Open Source Project_ (AOSP).
This project is lead by  Google.
		
The Android operating system can be divided into the four areas as depicted in the following graphic. 
An Android application developer typically works with the two layers on top to create new Android applications.

The levels can be described as:
		
* Applications - Contains the applications, like the Browser, Camera, Gallery, Music and Phone
* Application framework - An API which allows high-level interactions with the Android system
* Libraries and runtime - The libraries for many common framework functions, like graphic rendering, data storage, web browsing. 
Also contains the Android Runtime, as well as the core Java libraries for running Android applications.
* Linux kernel - Communication layer for the underlying hardware.

=== Android versions

The Android operating system is published in different versions, which are listed in the following table.

[[androidapplication]]
=== Android application
		
An _Android application_ (app) is a single installable unit which can be started and used independently.
An Android application consists of configuration files, Java source and resource files. 
You can define the following _components_ in your configuration files:

|Component |Description

|Application
|An Android application can have one `Application` class which is instantiated before any other Android component.
It is the last component which is stopped during application shutdown.
		
If not explicitly defined, Android creates a default application object for your application.

|Activity
|An activity is the visual representation of an Android application.
An Android application can have several activities.

Activities use views and fragments to create their user interface and to interact with the user. 

|Service
|A _service_ performs tasks without providing an user interface.
They can communicate with other Android components and send notifications to the user.
For example, a broadcast receiver can notify the user via the notification framework in Android.


|Broadcast receiver (short: receiver)
|A receiver can be registered to listen to system messages and intents. 
A receiver gets notified by the Android system if the specified event occurs.
		
For example, you can register a receiver for the event that the Android system finished the boot process. 
Or you can register for the event that the state of the phone changes, e.g., someone is calling.


|Content provider (short: provider)
|A provider defines a structured interface to application data. 
A provider can be used for accessing data within one application, but can also be used to share data with other applications.
		
Android contains an SQLite database which is frequently used in conjunction with a content provider. 
The SQLite database would store the data, which would be accessed via the provider.

=== Defining the user interface

The user interface of activities is defined with fragments, views and layout managers.
These elements are typically defined via an XML layout file.

_Views_ are user interface widgets, e.g., buttons or text fields. 
Views have attributes which can be used to configure their appearance and behavior.

_Layout managers_ (_ViewGroup_) are responsible for arranging other views. 

_Fragments_ are components which run in the context of an activity.
A fragment encapsulates application logic and layout information.
It is therefore easier to reuse them and to support devices of different size.
For example,  a smaller screen shows only one fragment with the option to navigate to the next screen.
On a larger screen it shows two fragments.
        
[[overview_context]]
=== Context
		
Instances of the class `android.content.Context` provide the connection to the Android system and actual device.
It gives access to the system and application resources and services.
For example, you can check the size of the current device display via it.
		
Activities and services extend the `Context` class. 
Therefore, they can be directly used to access the `Context`.
