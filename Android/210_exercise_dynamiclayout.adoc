== Exercise: Influence view layout at runtime

In this exercise you add radio buttons the layout of the application you created in <<androidstudio_starter>>. 
This application was exted in <<exercise_displayapopup>>.
Depending on the user selection the radio button arrangement will change from horizontal to vertical.

=== Add radio group and radio buttons to your layout

Open your layout file and add a radio group with two radio buttons to your layout.

Assign IDs to them, based on the following table.

.ID Assignment
|===
|ID|View

|orientation
|Radio Group

|horizontal
|First radio button

|vertical
|Second radio button
|===


The resulting layout file should be similar to the following listing.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/exercise_radiogroup/textlayout.txt[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Only the `RadioGroup` part needs to be added to your layout, the rest should already be there from previous exercises.

The resulting layout should look like the following screenshot.

=== Change radio group orientation dynamically

Change the `onCreate()` method in your activity.
Use the `findViewById()` method to find the `RadioGroup` in your layout.


Implement a listener on the radio group which changes the orientation of the radio buttons.
The new orientation should be based on the current selection of the radio buttons. 
The selected button, is identified by the ID parameter.


`RadioGroup` allows you to add a `RadioGroup.OnCheckedChangeListener` via the  setOnCheckedChangeListener()` method. 
This listener is notified if the selection of the radio group changes.

You can use the following code as template to implement the listener.

[source,java]
----
include::res/exercise_radiogroup/listener.txt[]
----

=== Validating
Run your application and select the different radio button.
Ensure that the orientation of the radio buttons changes based on your selection.
