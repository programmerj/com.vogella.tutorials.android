== Exercise: Create a temperature converter

In this exercise you learn how to create and consume Android resources.
		
This application is available on Google Play under the following URL: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.vogella.android.temperature
		
You can also scan the following barcode with your Android phone to install it via the Google Play application.

[[tutorialtemperature_project]]
=== Create Project
		
Create a new Android project with the following data.

.New Android project
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Value

|Application Name
|Temperature Converter

|Package name
|com.vogella.android.temperatureconverter

|Minimum SDK
|Latest Android release

|Template
|Empty Activity

|Activity
|MainActivity

|Layout
|activity_main

|Backwards Compability (AppCompat(
|false (not selected)
|===

=== Create attributes
		
Select the _res/values/strings.xml_ file to open the editor for this file. 
Add the Color and String definitions to the file as described by the following table.
		
.New attributes to add
[cols="1, 2, 2",options="header"]
|===
|Type
|Name
|Value

|Color
|myColor
|#F5F5F5

|String
|celsius
|to Celsius

|String
|fahrenheit
|to Fahrenheit

|String
|calc
|Calculate
|===

Afterwards the file should look similar the following.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/strings.xml[]
----
		
=== Creating the layout

		
Open the _res/layout/activity_main.xml_ file.
		
Remove any existing view from your layout, either directly from the XML source or via the graphical editor.
		
		
Afterwards add a `LinearLayout` with one `EditText` as child. 
Afterwards add a `RadioGroup` with two radio buttons and a button to your layout. 
Do this either directly in the XML file or via the graphical editor.
A simple way of organizing the components is to drag and drop them onto the _Component Tree_ view.

The result should look like the following screenshots. 
The first one shows the component view the second one the preview.

Switch to the XML tab of your layout file and verify that the file looks similar to the following listing. 

[NOTE]
====
The Android tools team changes the generated code from time to time, so your XML might look slightly different.
====		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/first/mainfirst.xml[]
----


[NOTE]
====	
You see some warning messages. 
You fix these in the following section of this exercise.
====

=== Edit view properties
		
Switch to the XML representation of the file and assign the `@string/celsius` value to the `android:text` property of the first radio button. 
Assign the `fahrenheit` string attribute to the `text` property of the second radio button.
		
image::temperature90.png[Change the text property of the radio button]

		
Ensure that the `checked` property is set to `true` for the first `RadioButton`.
		
		
Assign `@string/calc` to the text property of your button and assign the value `onClick` to the `onClick`  property.
		
Set the `inputType` property to `numberSigned` and `numberDecimal` on the `EditText`. 
As an example you can use the last line in the following XML snippet.
Also change its ID to "inputValue".
		
[source,java]
----
include::res//first/edittext.txt[]
----	


		
All your user interface components are contained in a layout. 
Assign the background color to this `Layout`.

Select _Color_ and then select `myColor` in the dialog. 
As an example, you can use the last line in the following XML snippet.

	
[source,java]
----
include::res/first/backgroundcolor.txt[]
----
		
		
Afterwards the background should change to the `whitesmoke` color. It might be difficult to see the difference.
		
Switch to the _activity_main.xml_ tab and verify that the XML is correct.

[[tutorialtemperature_utility]]
=== Create utiliy class

Create the following utility class to convert from celsius to fahrenheit and vice versa.

[source,java]
----		
include::res/first/ConverterUtil.java[]
----

=== Change the activity code
		
Change the 	`MainActivity` to the following

[source,java]
----
include::res/first/MainActivity.java[]
----

=== Start the application
		
Start your Android application and type in a number, select your conversion and press the button.
The result
should be
displayed and the other
option should get
selected.
