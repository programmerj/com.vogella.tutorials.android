== Android and JSON

=== Included standard library
	
The Android platform includes the `json.org` library which allows processing and creating JSON files. 

[NOTE]
====
Prefer using open source libraries like http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaLibrary-Gson/article.html[Gson] or https://github.com/square/moshi[Moshi for JSON processing.
These libraries are easier to use, faster and provide more flexibility
====

=== Example: Reading JSON

Converting a JSON string into a JSON object is also simple.
Create the following coding for the activity. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/ParseJSON.java[]
----

<1> method which provides a JSON string, left out for brevity

[WARNING]
====
The code example cannot run in the main thread in Android. 
Ensure to run this snippet outside the main thread.

=== Write JSON
	
Writing JSON is very simple. Just create the JSONObject or JSONArray and use the toString() method.
	
[source,txt]

include::res/writeJSON.txt[]
