== Exercise: Write a test for an intent with Espresso

=== Create project which is tested
		
Create a new Android project with the _testing.android.vogella.com.simpleactivity_ package and the Empty Activity template.
		
		
Add a second activity called `SecondActivity` to your project via menu:File[New>Activity>Empty Activity].
This activity should use a layout with at least one `TextView`. 
The id of the `TextView` should be "resultText" and its text should be set to "Started".
		
Add an `EditText` field to the layout of the `MainActivity` class.
		
		
Add a button to the layout used by _MainActivity_. 
If this button is clicked, the second activity should be started.
		
		
Put the text `EditText` field as extra into the intent using "text" as key. 
Also put the "http://www.vogella.com" String as extra into the intent using the key "URL".
		
		
Here is some example code for the `MainActivity`.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/activity/MainActivity.java[]
----

=== Write tests
		
Write a Espresso test for the activity which tests the following:
		
* Check that the layout of the MainActivity contains a button with the `R.id.button` ID
* Ensure that the text on the button is "Start new activity"
* Ensure that if the getActivity.onClick() method is called, that the correct intent is triggered. 
This intent should contain the String extra (hasExtra("URL", "http://www.vogella.com").
		
		
=== Validating
	
Your test code should look similar to the following example code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/activity/TestIntent.java[]
