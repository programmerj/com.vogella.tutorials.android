The
_android-maven-plugin_
plug-in allows to build Android
applications via
Maven.
	
The webpage of this maven plug-in is located under:

The Eclipse support of this plug-in is provided by the

You only have to install Maven, write a correct
_pom.xml_
file and issue
the commands to Maven to build, install and run your
application.
	
The following will build your Android application via Maven.
	
[source,java]

This will create the application and places the
_.apk_
file in the
<filename class="directory">target_
folder.

If you want to install the application via Maven on your Android
device, you can use the
following command.
	
[source,java]
----

If more than one device is
available you can specify the relevant
device in your pom.xml. Maven
can also start and stop an Android
virtual device automatically for
you.
	
You can also start the application via Maven.
