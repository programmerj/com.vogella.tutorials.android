== Vector drawables
	
Android 5.0 includes the possibility to define vector drawables,
similar to svg files but with a limited scope. The
following listing
demonstrates its usage in the
_vectordrawable.xml_
file. Using vector drawables has the advantages that this drawables
automatically scale to the density of the device.

Android also support animated vector drawables via the  `AnimatedVectorDrawable` class.
It allows to combine vector drawables with animations. 
See http://blog.sqisland.com/2014/10/first-look-at-animated-vector-drawable.html for  examples.
	
Vector drawables are also available for older platform via the support library as `VectorDrawableCompat`.
