== XML processing in Android
	
The Java programming language provides several standard libraries
for processing XML files. The SAX and the
DOM 
XML parsers
are also 
available on
Android. 
	
The SAX and DOM parsers API is on Android the same as in
standard Java. SAX and DOM have their limitations, therefore it is not
recommended to use them on Android.
Therefore this tutorial does not
give an
example for the usage
of this
library.
	
The Java standard provides also the Stax parser. This parser is
not part of
the Android platform.
	
Android provides for XML parsing and writing the
`XmlPullParser`
class. This parser is not available in standard Java but is similar to
the Stax parser. The parser is hosted at
http://www.xmlpull.org/[ http://www.xmlpull.org/].
	
On Android it is recommended to use the
`XmlPullParser`. It has a relatively simple API compared to SAX and DOM and is fast
and requires less memory than the DOM API.
