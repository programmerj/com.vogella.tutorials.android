===	Unit testing in Android


A unit test verifies in isolation the functionality of a certain component.
For example, assume a button in an Android activity is used to start another activity. 
A unit test would determine, if the corresponding intent was issued, not if the second activity was started

A unit tests for an Android application can be:

- local unit test - which runs on the JVM
- Android unit test - which runs on the Android runtime

If they run on the JVM, they are executed against a modified version of the `android.jar` Android library.
In this version all final modifiers have been stripped off. 
This makes it easier to use mocking libraries, like Mockito.

The local unit tests of an Android project should be located in the `app/src/test` folder. 

[[androidtesting_unittests_gradledependencies]]
=== Required dependencies in the Gradle build file

To use JUnit tests for your Android application, you need to add it as dependency to your Gradle build file.

[source,gradle]

=== Running the unit tests 

==== Using Gradle

Run your unit tests with the `gradlew test`	command.

[[androidtesting_projectstructure_runtunittestsas]]
==== Using Android Studio

To run a unit test, right-click on your test class in the _Project_ window and select _Run_.

[[androidtesting_projectstructure_testresults]]
=== Location of test reports

The Test reports are created in the `app/build/reports/tests/debug/` directory. 
The `index.html` gives an overview and links to the individual test pages.

[[androidtesting_projectstructure_mockingmethods]]
=== Activating default return values for mocked methods in android.jar

By default, all calls to methods in the modified `android.jar` file throw exceptions. 
This default should ensure that your unit tests only test your code and do not depend on any particular behavior of the Android platform. 
If you want to configure a certain behavior, you can use a mocking framework to replace these call.

You can also instruct the Gradle build system to return default values for method calls in the `android.jar`with the following configuration in your Gradle build file.
