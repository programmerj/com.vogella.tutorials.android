[[androidtesting_assertions]]
=== Android additional assertion

The Android testing API provides the `MoreAsserts` and `ViewAsserts` classes
in addition to the standard JUnit `Assert` class.

[[androidtesting_testgroups]]
=== Test groups

The `@SmallTest`, `@MediumTest`and `@LargeTest`annotations allows to classify tests.


This allows you to run, for example, only short running tests.
You may run your long running tests on a continuous integration server.


To run only selected tests you can configure the `InstrumentationTestRunner` via your Gradle plug-in.
The following listing is an example for your `build.gradle` file to run only the tests annotated with `@SmallTests`.

[[androidtesting_testfilter]]
=== Test filtering

You can annotate tests with annotations. The Android test runner allows to filter these tests.

.Annotations for filtering tests

[[androidtesting_flaky]]
===	Flaky tests

Actions in Android are sometimes time dependent. 
To tell Android to repeat a test once it fails, use the `@FlakyTest` annotation. 
Via the `tolerance` attribute of this annotation you can define how many times the test should be repeated before marking it as failed.
