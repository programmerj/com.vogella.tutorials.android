== Introduction into Android testing

=== Testing Android applications

Android applications run on a variety of devices.
Also the Android framework and the surrounding open source frameworks evolve at a high speed.
To ensure that you application works well, it is import to write software tests.
This helps you to enhance and maintain the Android application.

Unit testing for Android can be classified into:

* Local unit tests - tests which can run on the JVM. 
* Instrumented unit tests - tests which require the Android system.

Local unit tests run much faster compared to the time required to deploy and run tests on an Android device.
Prefer writing local unit tests and only run tests on Android, if you require a real Android system.

If you write local unit test and have dependencies to Android API, you need to replace them, e.g., via a mocking framework like Mockito. 

=== What to test on Android applications

Your test should focus on the business logic of your application. 
A good rule of thumb is to have the following distribution of tests:

* 70-80 % unit tests to ensure stability of your code basis
* 20-30 % functional tests to ensure that the application really works
* some cross functional tests if your application integrates intensively with other Application components

You should test your application at least on one device with the lowest possible configuration.
In addition you should test on one device with the highest available configuration, e.g., pixel density, screen resolution to ensure that it works fine on these devices.

=== Tooling support for Android testing

The https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/[Android Testing Support library] (ATSL) project from Google provides tooling for Android testing.
For example, it  (`AndroidJUnitRunner`).

[NOTE]
====
If you run local unit tests, a special version of the android.jar (also known as the `Android mockable jar`) is created by the tooling.
This modified JAR file is provided to the unit test so that all fields, methods and classes are available. 
Any call to the Android mockable JAR results, by default, in an exception, but you can configure Android to return default values. See <<androidtesting_projectstructure_mockingmethods>> for details.
====

The library provides a JUnit 4-compatible test runner (`AndroidJUnitRunner`), the Espresso test framework and the UI Automator test framework. 
Espresso test framework can be used to test the User Interface of your application. 
UI Automator allows to write cross application functional tests.

AndroidJunitRunner provides access to the instrumentation API, via the `InstrumentationRegistery`.

* `InstrumentationRegistry.getInstrumentation()`, returns the `Instrumentation` currently running.
* `InstrumentationRegistry.getContext()`, returns the `Context` of this Instrumentationâ€™s package.
* `InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext()`, returns the application `Context` of the target application.
* `InstrumentationRegistry.getArguments()`, returns a copy of arguments `Bundle` that was passed to this Instrumentation. This is useful when you want to access the command line arguments passed to the instrumentation for your test.

It also gives access to the life cycle via the `ActivityLifecycleMonitorRegistry`.

[[androidtesting_projectstructure]]
=== Android project organization for tests

The following is the default directory structure for your application and test code:

* `app/src/main/java`- for your source code of your main application build
* `app/src/test/java` - for any unit test which can run on the JVM
* `app/src/androidTest/java` - for any test which should run on an Android device


If you follow this conversion, the Android build system runs your tests on the correct target (JVM or Android device).

[TIP]
====
If you receive the following error message: "error duplicate files in path. Path in archive: LICENSE.txt" you can add the following to your `app/gradle.build` file.
