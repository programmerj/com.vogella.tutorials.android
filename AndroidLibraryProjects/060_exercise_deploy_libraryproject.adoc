== Exercise: Deploy a library project

Create a new library project called `com.vogella.libraries.testlib` with the same top level package.
Add the following to its build.gradle file.

[source, gradle]
----

apply plugin: 'maven'

group = 'com.vogella.libraries'
version = '1.0'

uploadArchives {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
    }
}
----

Deploy it by running the `gradle uploadArchives` task.

You can now define a dependency to this library, by adding  mavenLocal() and using:

[source,gradle]
----
compile 'com.vogella.libraries.YOURLIBARYNAME`
----
